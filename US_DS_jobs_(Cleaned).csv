About Us

We offer a Software as a Solution (SaaS) platform that connects previously disparate data from within an electronic medical record and transforms it into the type of clinical insight that can help providers determine appropriate care and reimbursement.

The Contractor shall develop analytic capabilities aimed at facilitating information discovery, summarization, or to aid the interpretation of patterns within. This development activity may include identifying existing analytic tradecraft of value and performing tech transfer as necessary. The Contractor shall have experience with data science and have successfully delivered analytic capabilities.

The Contractor shall assess and validate candidate systems, applications, and open source modules as potential elements for inclusion into the Customer system. The Contractor shall identify key interdependencies, roadblocks, issues, and risks with modifying existing systems and develop/integrate/implement a plan to proactively address these issues in a timely manner.

The Contractor shall evaluate existing Customer capabilities, familiarizing themselves with system architecture and inherit the development responsibilities for those capabilities and systems as directed by the Customer. The Contractor shall work with the Customer to generate and document requirements for new system development. The Contractor shall develop new systems to satisfy Customer approved requirements, and subsequently develop, document, and execute test plans, procedures, and scenarios for acceptance testing. The Contractor shall validate and verify that the developed software successfully meets Customer requirements and interfaces properly with related systems through configuration, installation, and performance testing of the software.

The Contractor shall comply with the Customers Assessment and Authorization process, addressing auditing requirements, and providing required system documentation through the accreditation process.

Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.

Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle.

Location: Ideally Austin, TX, Denver, CO or Redwood City, CA

We will, however, also look at 100% remote talent based elsewhere in the USA

What we do:
We are a cloud-native SaaS machine data analytics platform, solving complex monitoring problems for DevOps, SecOps and ITOps teams. Customers love our product because it allows them to easily monitor and optimize their mission critical, large scale applications.

Massive Scale:
Our microservices architecture in AWS ingests hundreds of terabytes daily across many geographic regions. Millions of queries a day analyze hundreds of petabytes of data.

At Sumo Logic, we are building a data platform designed to power the analytics and investigations that are common in the Security Operation Centers of large enterprises. It is designed to accept hundreds of billions of events from security-relevant data sources (detection products, network sensors, log shippers, inventory systems) per day. It is cloud-native, with no plan to support an on-premise deployment. It is multi-tenant, and is designed to simultaneously process events from thousands of our customers. And, it is security-focused — it is designed to perform the kinds of stateful analyses that security analysts demand.

We are building this platform the way startups should — with ruthless prioritization, and with a live and demanding customer base. By joining as a Data Engineer, you have the opportunity to make our vision a reality, one feature at a time.

What You Will be Doing
Building, improving, maintaining, and scaling stream processing services.

Giving feedback on our standards. Holding your team mates to them.
Collaborating with teammates on major feature designs. Sometimes, you will own features, sometimes others will.
Helping our team grow organically. We value referrals. We value your feedback on candidates.
Who You Are
You are a software engineer. (We treat our data systems as software systems, and engineer them accordingly.)
You love working with data. (Small data. Big data. All the data.)
You are excited to optimize for events per second (not requests per second).
You have deep experience working with the technologies we use: Kafka, RocksDB, ElasticSearch, JanusGraph, Postgres, Spark, HBase.
You know (or want to write software in) Scala.
You love collecting data about your software as much as writing software that collects data. We measure everything. We make data-driven decisions.
You are collaborative. Nothing this hard can be accomplished by working alone. We work as a team.
Minimum Bachelors in Computer Science or similar technical education. Masters or PhD preferred!

At Statespace we’re using cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and video games to revolutionize the way that humans improve.

Our first product (Aim Lab) is a personalized, AI-powered analytics and training platform for competitive gamers and Esports athletes. Aim Lab has well over a million users and the best user community in the whole wide world (we may be biased).

Our team consists of scientists, designers, engineers, and game industry vets coming together from places like NYU, MTV, NASA, Yale, Nintendo, and the NFL. We are well-funded and supported by some of the world’s best investors and entrepreneurs, including Khosla Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Lux Capital, Expa Capital, and WndrCo.

Our Culture

Weird. Non-traditional background. Underdog. Outcast. If people have used any of these words or phrases to describe you...welcome home. Kick-ass engineer or designer without a degree? Come join our team.

We hire talented, self-motivated people and get out of their way. We are based in NYC but have a remote work culture and are looking for exceptional people to join our team regardless of their physical location.
We value performance, not hours worked (or when you work them). We believe you shouldn’t have to miss your kid’s play or doctor’s appointment for the sake of adhering to an arbitrary work schedule.
However, if you are looking for a job where you are happy to just collect a nice paycheck and/or nap under your desk like George Costanza, we are not the right fit for you (we don’t even have desks).
The work we do is hard, and therefore, a key company goal is to mitigate needless obstacles that prevent our team members from accomplishing their goals. To that end, our vacation policy is “take it whenever you want to”, our PTO policy is “take it whenever you need to”. We offer very generous medical, dental, vision, and retirement plans.

Reporting to the Director of Research, the Junior Data Analyst will work within the Science Team.

Both Statespace, overall, and the Science Team are growing rapidly, so you will be working in a changing environment and will have opportunities to grow. Being a gamer isn’t required, but you’ll be expected to learn about the industry and our users, over time.


Key Responsibilities
Create and maintain dashboards including data visualizations for Product Analytics, KPI & Benchmarking Metrics, Marketing Attribution, & User Behavior
Support the Director of Research and Science Team by producing weekly and monthly reports to communicate insights to other teams
Ad hoc product and program metrics and queries
Collaborate with key stakeholders across the Company to understand their needs and how we can leverage data to improve their processes

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training
Programming: Experience with SAS is a must (comfortable with SAS macro language, advanced DATA step techniques such as hashes, and PROC SQL); experience with Python, Stata, R, or SQL is a plus
Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together. Part way through the interview process, we incorporate a lightweight at-home exercise that serves as the basis for a technical interview. The exercise gives us an outlet to show you what kind of problems this role would tackle and offers you an opportunity to show us how you would approach the work.",-1.0,Emendata,"Burlingame, CA",1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Less than $1 million (USD),0,88,142,Emendata,CA,Burlingame,-1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Data Analyst,Senior,3709,115.0

Location: Ideally Austin, TX, Denver, CO or Redwood City, CA

We will, however, also look at 100% remote talent based elsewhere in the USA

What we do:
We are a cloud-native SaaS machine data analytics platform, solving complex monitoring problems for DevOps, SecOps and ITOps teams. Customers love our product because it allows them to easily monitor and optimize their mission critical, large scale applications.

Massive Scale:
Our microservices architecture in AWS ingests hundreds of terabytes daily across many geographic regions. Millions of queries a day analyze hundreds of petabytes of data.

At Sumo Logic, we are building a data platform designed to power the analytics and investigations that are common in the Security Operation Centers of large enterprises. It is designed to accept hundreds of billions of events from security-relevant data sources (detection products, network sensors, log shippers, inventory systems) per day. It is cloud-native, with no plan to support an on-premise deployment. It is multi-tenant, and is designed to simultaneously process events from thousands of our customers. And, it is security-focused — it is designed to perform the kinds of stateful analyses that security analysts demand.

We are building this platform the way startups should — with ruthless prioritization, and with a live and demanding customer base. By joining as a Data Engineer, you have the opportunity to make our vision a reality, one feature at a time.

What You Will be Doing
Building, improving, maintaining, and scaling stream processing services.
Writing code. Reviewing code. Revising code.
Giving feedback on our standards. Holding your team mates to them.
Collaborating with teammates on major feature designs. Sometimes, you will own features, sometimes others will.
Helping our team grow organically. We value referrals. We value your feedback on candidates.
Who You Are
You are a software engineer. (We treat our data systems as software systems, and engineer them accordingly.)
You love working with data. (Small data. Big data. All the data.)
You are excited to optimize for events per second (not requests per second).
You have deep experience working with the technologies we use: Kafka, RocksDB, ElasticSearch, JanusGraph, Postgres, Spark, HBase.
You know (or want to write software in) Scala.
You love collecting data about your software as much as writing software that collects data. We measure everything. We make data-driven decisions.
You are collaborative. Nothing this hard can be accomplished by working alone. We work as a team.
Minimum Bachelors in Computer Science or similar technical education. Masters or PhD preferred!

Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
